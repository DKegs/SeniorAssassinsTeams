# SeniorAssassinsTeams
This program takes an input of any number of teams and generates the order in which the game is played.  
Each team is hunting another team and are getting hunted by a different team, this program randomly assigns each team to another team.  
This program takes the input teams, randomizes the order, making sure there are no duplicates or two teams both hunting each other, then outputs it in a readable fashion.

I created this program to help run and manage a Senior Class event at my high school on my own.
This helped me to manage the game while still being unbiased in the order by which the teams hunt.
